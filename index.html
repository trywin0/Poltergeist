      Poltergeist is a sandbox game currently in development by me & other people I work with (freelancers & friends)
      <br>
      In Poltergeist you play, as well, a Poltergeist & you're able to freely roam around the map, which at the moment
      the only map is a suburban neighborhood. <br>
      You're able to flicker lights, break lights, open / close & slam doors, turn on sinks, flush toilets, open
      drawers, throw stuff around rooms, knock on walls, break windows & possess people. <br>
      Everything costs energy to do, the only way to get energy is to either succ it from electronics and/or scare
      people and feed off of their fear. <br>
      If you possess someone you're able to freely roam around in 1st person as them & use knives, guns, & even cars.
      <br>
      Once you've broken the law police will obviously come. <br>
      You can fight back but once you die or run out of energy you leave that body & return into poltergeist mode. <br>
      There are "Children of God" & "Children of Satan" - Children of Satan are automatically possessable whereas
      Children of
      God must be broken down, breaking them down means destroying their mental stability by scaring them, like nearly
      killing them. <br>
      There are priests so once the priests hear word of a haunting in a house they will come and purify that house,
      making the house not enterable anymore & making the people in that house not possessable.
